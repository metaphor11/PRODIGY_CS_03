## Code Explanation

### `check_password_strength(password)`

This function assesses the strength of the input password based on several criteria and provides feedback on how to improve it.

- **Criteria Checks**:

  - `uppercase_criteria`: Password must include at least one uppercase letter.
  - `lowercase_criteria`: Password must include at least one lowercase letter.
  - `digit_criteria`: Password must include at least one digit.
  - `special_char_criteria`: Password must include at least one special character.

- **Scoring**:
  - The score is the sum of the criteria met.

- **Feedback**:
  - Provides feedback based on which criteria are not met.

- **Strength Evaluation**:
  - Password is considered "Strong" if all criteria are met.
  - Password is "Moderate" if 4 criteria are met.
